November. A drizzly gray pantena enveloped the Steel City. Things had been moving slowly lately:
The ceaseless drifting of sleet, the steady crawl of lifeless commuters. The trickle of familiar 
clients - nothing but lay readers for weeks. Things had taken a downward turn after the fresh
expression recession in '35, and two years later they were still looking bad. Nobody was 
having an easy time getting work in the North, but things seemed especially bleak for semi-
retired non-conformist church investigators. We didn't even have a union.

Upon entering the dimly lit office, a folded note sat waiting on the doormat. It simply read "THE DATA IS A LIE".


I made the familiar pilgrimage from my work desk to my leisure desk, reflecting on the providence
that had befallen me. I opened the second draw down and partook of the spirit. Drifted to the 
bathroom for morning ablutions, which I like to squeeze in sometime before noon. These rituals
had flourised as external fellowship slowly declined. Hence my surprise at the sudden, soft, 
double-tap knock on my door.

The apartement's dimensions were apportioned according to some inscrutable method that rendered
every space within no more than four feet from the external door. I grit my teeth embarked on
the commute, not savouring, I confess, the thought of human contact. I hadn't shaved, but in the 
back of my head I took refuge in the idea that in my line of work this my grant an aesthetic
of authenticity. 

Invigorated though I was by my malty breakfast, it took me a few seconds to recognise the aged
visage that awaited me outside my home. A morning of surprises. 

"Justin" I concluded, almost involuntarily. 

He didn't say anything for a while.

"I think perhaps I'd better come in"
