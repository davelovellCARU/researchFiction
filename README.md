# researchFiction
A private repo containing a README.MD and a .txt research-noir thriller.

# Hello chums.

Github gives you the option of initalising your repo with a README markdown (not Rmarkdown) file. Neat huh?

You can edit this file on GitHub, as you can with all human-readable files. 

This is a *public* repo, which means that anybody in the world can see it if they have the link. Even so, you will need permission from me in order to _push_ here. _Cloning_, _pulling_ and _forking_ (similar to cloning, don't worry about it) can all be done by anyone. 

Enjoy the introduction to this novella I'm working on (since just now). I invite you to collaborate with me on producing the innagural work of the _research-noir_ genre. 

Warm regards

Dave
